# Airtable plugin

This plugin allows one to get records from a [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) table.

As of November 2017, the API lacks of methods to manage the schema of a table. Hence, this plugin does not offer writing/export to Airtable.

## Changelog

**Version 0.1.0 (2017-11-17)**

* Initial release
